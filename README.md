Easy Machine Learning guide book

This is a simplified machine learning guidebook written entirely by myself. The initial idea was to find a path to learn machine learning independently, as our school doesn’t offer any useful courses on the subject. Later, I realized I could write down what I’d learned as a book for my friends and others to read, which also serves as a way to review the material myself.

The book is primarily based on lectures from Stanford’s CS229 and Machine Learning by Zhi-Hua Zhou. I removed some outdated or irrelevant content and added insights from blogs I’ve read. I typed this all in Notion myself, so there might be some typo and so on, please let me know if you get one.

鉴于现在国内大多数本科课程大多无法应对大家就业和实际使用的需求，直接看《机器学习》或者《统计学习方法》又难免比较难以入门，特参考CS229和周，李两位老师的书写出了这本参考书，希望你能喜欢。
